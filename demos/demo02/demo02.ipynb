    "## Computing Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing environments are the software spaces in which you do your work. You're probably used to working within a single environment: the operating system and collection of software you've installed on your personal computer—Word, Excel, Google Chrome, Adobe Acrobat, etc. If you need other software for a specific purpose you install it. For this class, you added these new programs to your computing environment:\n",
    "- MiniConda\n",
    "- GitHub Desktop\n",
    "- VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also install software in virtual environments, which allows you to keep different versions or add-ons isolated for different purposes. This is especially common for programming. I tend to create new environments for each class or project. Sometimes I even create new environments just to try things out so I don't mess up an environment I've set up carefully for working on a specific project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conda Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda—we're using MiniConda—is a common software for managing Python environments. [This is a handy reference](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for creating and deleting environments in Conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to use Conda is on the command line. We can use the Terminal on Mac or Anaconda Prompt on Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a new Conda environment for this class called `688y` by copying this into the command prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create -n 688y python=3.13`\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to run Python on the command line, we could activate this environment by running this prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda activate 688y`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can also tell VS Code to use this environment in the Select Kernel dialog in the upper right-hand corner of the VS Code window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VS Code: Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "An IDE is software for writing code that also includes handy tools for running and testing code, working with version control, and other aspects of development. VS Code, made by Microsoft, is one of the most commonly-used IDEs for many different coding languages. It has lots of bells and whistles that we won't use in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few settings in VS Code that can be helpful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Default indentation (I like to use 4 spaces)\n",
    "- Color themes (I like \"Light Modern\"; find one you like)\n",
    "\n",
    "### JupyterLab: Alternative Development Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "If VS Code isn't properly finding your conda environment (there have been some bugs due to a recent update), you may need to use an alternative development environment. I recommend JupyterLab, which is simpler and more reliable, but requires a little more work with the command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install JupyterLab by opening your Terminal on Mac or Anaconda Prompt on Windows and activating your conda environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda activate 688y`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then install JupyterLab with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional: Navigate to your local repository with the `cd` (change directories) command. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "`cd /Users/[your user name]/github/ursp688y_sp2026`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can copy your specific path by right clicking on the repository in GitHub Desktop and selecting \"Copy Repo Path\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Open Jupyter Lab with this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`jupyter lab`\n",
    "\n",
    "This should automatically open your web browser and launch JupyterLab within it."
